  <h1>How to Achieve Orgasm - Male</h1>
  <h2>Ejaculation is not orgasm!</h2>
  
  <p>To begin with, we need to dispel the myth that ejaculation is orgasm. Ejaculation is actually the climax, not the orgasm. After ejaculation, the game is over. Unfortunately, only 0.1% of men are aware of this.
    For a man to experience orgasm, he needs to lift his semen upward towards his glands through the connecting canal.</p>

  <h3>How to lift your semen upward instead of allowing it to leak out of you?</h3>
  <p>When you feel that ejaculation is ready, pause for a moment (you donÂ´t need to come out of the vagina) and pull your testicles down to separate them from the penis. Then, perform a squeeze of the anus to which you will add another squeeze. You will feel as if your anus is lifting upward, which is actually happening. The muscles around the anus and the muscles that hold the penis in erection will exert pressure on your prostate, and the semen from the prostate will move upward under that pressure. When you lift your semen from the prostate, you will first fill your adrenal glands with it, and for the first time in your life, you will feel orgasm. I assume the sensation is similar for everyone, but we all differ a bit; generally, there will be a feeling of warmth in the kidney area and euphoria. Continue with penetration afterward.</p>
  <p>When the next sensation of ejaculation readiness arises, repeat the same process, and continue doing so until you reach enlightenment. This happens when you manage to deliver your semen to the pineal gland.</p>

<h3>Note: When, after the third lift, you reach the chest gland, you will feel arrhythmia. Do not be afraid, this is normal.</h3>
