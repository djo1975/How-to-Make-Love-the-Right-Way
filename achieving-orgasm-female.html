  <h1>How to Achieve Orgasm - Female</h1>
  <h2>A man's responsibility is to satisfy a woman!</h2>
  
  <p>Do not forget this, and do not allow men, influenced by the porn industry, to mistreat you. For a woman to experience orgasm, it is necessary to focus on her G-spot at the point of penetration.</p>

  <h2>What is the G-spot?</h2>
  <p>The G-spot is an area in your vagina that you can connect with your brain by concentrating on the part where you feel the greatest stimulation. When you achieve this, you will create a receiver of male sexual (life) energy in your vagina directly connected to your pineal gland, and that is the path to whole-body orgasm and enlightenment.</p>

<h3>How to become aware of your vagina and easily place your G-spot at the point of penetration?</h3>
<p>Jony eggs are an ideal tool for practice. Start with the largest egg in the set. The set consists of 3 eggs, and as you strengthen and become familiar with your vagina, progress to smaller eggs.</p>
  <p>While you are still in bed and have finished with breast massage and nipple-pulling exercises, play with your clitoris to prepare your vagina for inserting the egg.</p>
  <p>Once you have inserted the egg, pull the thread, and use your vaginal muscles to ensure the egg does not fall out. Focus on your vagina and the egg inside it.
  Through this exercise, you will strengthen the muscles of your vagina and become aware of every part of it, so that you can easily place the center of your attention at the stimulation point.</p>
    <p>Feel free to find more exercises with Jony eggs on the internet, they have significant benefits for the health of your vagina.</p>
