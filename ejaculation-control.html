  <h1>How to control ejaculation</h1>
  
  <h2>Massaging Testicles Exercise</h2>

<p>Take the testicles between your thumb on one side and your index and middle fingers on the other side. Massage them in circular motions until you feel they have slightly increased in size. You can choose to do 60 circles, which would take approximately 1 minute of your time. Repeat this exercise three times a day, totaling around 3 minutes per day.</p>
<p>During this exercise, several things can happen in your body:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased Testosterone Production: Massaging the testicles can stimulate the production and release of testosterone. Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone responsible for the development and maintenance of male sexual characteristics.</li>
<li>Stimulation of Other Hormones: Testicle massage can also stimulate the release of other hormones such as luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which play an important role in regulating testicular function.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pelvic Floor Exercises-Kegel</h2>

<p>When urinating, interrupt the flow of urine and remember the muscles you used. Start consciously contracting those muscles. For example, do 60 contractions three times a day. This exercise takes about 3 minutes a day, and you can do it anytime and anywhere, like while crossing the street or waiting in line at the grocery store.</p>
<p>Why should you do this exercise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strengthening the Pelvic Floor Muscles: Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles in men, including the muscles that support the bladder, rectum, and penis. This muscle strengthening can improve bladder control and sexual function.</li>
<li>Improving Sexual Function: Kegel exercises can help men improve sexual function, including erectile function and ejaculatory control. Strengthening the pelvic floor muscles can provide better support to the penis during erection and improve control over ejaculation.</li>
<li>Preventing Prostate and Sexual Disorders: Regularly performing Kegel exercises can help maintain prostate health in men. These pelvic floor muscles support the prostate, and regular exercise helps maintain their functionality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ejaculation Control Exercise</h2>

<p>Once a day, preferably just before showering, apply oil (baby oil or olive oil) to the penis. Form a ring around the penis with your thumb and index finger and stroke from the base over the shaft and glans 50 times to the left, 50 times to the right, 50 times upward, 50 times downward, 50 times forward, and 50 times from glans to base. If you feel ejaculation approaching, pause and use your thumb and index finger to pull down on the testicles until the urge to ejaculate subsides.</p>
<p>This exercise requires privacy and approximately ten minutes of your time. It is the most demanding exercise, but if you want to live long and happy, set aside 20 minutes a day to work on yourself. Once you master this exercise, you will boost your self-confidence and allow yourself to experience orgasm for the first time. You can find more information about male orgasm on the website.</p>
