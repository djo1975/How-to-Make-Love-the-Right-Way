        <h2>Sexual-"Function"</h2>
        <p>Urologists and sexologists generally consider a man to be sexually functional if he can achieve an erection, maintain it for 2 minutes, and ejaculate.</p>
        <p>For women, if the vagina becomes lubricated, and she is satisfied, even if it's by bringing her partner to ejaculation, she is also considered sexually functional. </p>
        <h3> The average duration of penetration is considered normal to be between 5 to 7 minutes.</h3>
        <p>In a period of 5 to 7 minutes, achieving anything substantial is unlikely and may lead to disappointment.</p> 
        <p>When you are engaged in a task that is not going well, your adrenal glands release Cortisol and Adrenaline. When Cortisol and Adrenaline levels rise, you may feel the urge to escape, resulting in a loss of motivation for that particular task.</p>
        <p> This is a sure path into a vicious cycle, which is a major contributor to sexual dysfunction.</p>
        <h1>How to solve Sexual-Dysfunction</h1>
        <h1>Man</h1>
        <h2>The most important thing is to regain your self-confidence</h2> 
        <p>Before you start exercising, check the health of your prostate. Visit a urologist and check if you have any prostate issues. Only after verifying the condition of your prostate should you proceed with the exercises. All exercises are explained on the <a href="ejaculation-control.html">ejaculation-control page</a>.</p>
        <p> The average length of the vagina from the entrance to the cervix is 7.5 to 10 cm, and you don't need to have a giant penis. A penis of 10 centimeters is perfectly fine if you follow the instructions on the <a href="how-to-satisfy-a-women.html">how-to-satisfy-a-woman page</a>. The shape of the penis is more important than the size. A mushroom-shaped tip is desirable.</p>
      <h2>How to improve the shape of the penis</h2>
      <p>Simply, while practicing the "Sharpening the Spear" exercise, squeeze the body of your penis to make the glans swell. After completing the exercise, you will also improve the shape of your penis.</p>
      <h1>Woman</h1>
      <h2>You are the receiver of sacred sexual energy, not an object from porn movies.</h2> 
      <h3>Women, stop allowing men to penetrate your throat, pull your hair, slap you, spit on you, flip you upside down...</h3>
        <p>Your G-spot is in your vagina and you set it with your brain. The easiest way to achieve sexual satisfaction is explained on the <a href="how-to-satisfy-a-women.html">how-to-satisfy-a-woman page</a>.</p> 
        <p>Practice how to handle your G spot as explained on the <a href="achieving-orgasm-female.html">achieving-orgasm-female page</a>.</p>
