  <h1>How to Control Menstrual Cycle</h1>
  
  <h2>Massaging Breasts Exercise</h2>
  <p>It takes an average of 9 months to successfully master this technique. It is necessary to practice independently because if you practice with a partner, different hormones will be produced due to the presence of oxytocin.</p>
    <p>Massage your breasts in circular motions 3 times a day for 60 strokes each time. You can use some lubricants like baby oil. This will improve blood and lymph circulation through your breasts. To know that you are doing well, the milk glands in your breasts will slightly swell, so feel them before and after exercising.
   
    <h2>Pulling Nipples Exercise</h2> 
    <p>Do this exercise once a day, I suggest before going to sleep or after waking up while you are in bed. Pulling your nipples to the point of pain and release them abruptly, focusing on the lower abdomen. Pulling nipples will initiate Prolactin production. Prolactin has a suppressive effect on gonadotropins, hormones secreted by the pituitary gland that directly affect ovarian function. When prolactin levels are elevated, it can lead to a reduction in the secretion of gonadotropins, such as luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This will prevent ovulation, and consequently, menstruation.</p>
      <p>You need to concentrate on the lower abdomen because pulling and releasing nipples will cause contractions of the uterus. It is necessary to be aware of the muscles of your uterus so that you can contract it independently or consciously, as this will maintain the health of your uterus. By contracting the muscles of the uterus, you will initiate the production of estrogen and progesterone, necessary hormones for maintaining uterine health.</p>
    
    <h3>If you want to ovulate, simply stop exercising.</h3>
    
    <h2>Why control the menstrual cycle?</h2>
    <p>You will save yourself the loss of life energy needed to create an egg. There will be no pain and bleeding during menstruation. You won't need contraceptive pills, so you will get rid of the chemistry and energy needed to clear anything from the body... And a lot of money you will save.</p>
