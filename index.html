  <h1>How to Make Love the Right Way</h1>
  <h2>It's the man's responsibility to satisfy the woman in order to be satisfied himself!</h2>
  
  <p>Making love the right way involves mutual satisfaction and attention to each partner's needs. During intimate contact, kisses play an important role and should not be skipped.</p>

  <h3>The Gateway of Kisses</h3>
  <p>Kisses are the first physical contact with your beloved, and they shouldn't be skipped because they have their own significance on this journey. During kissing, our bodies release hormones such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Oxytocin: Known as the "love hormone" or "bonding hormone," oxytocin helps create feelings of closeness, trust, and connection between partners.</li>
    <li>Dopamine: Kisses stimulate the release of dopamine, which is associated with feelings of pleasure, euphoria, and reward. This hormone triggers excitement and happiness during kissing.</li>
    <li>Serotonin: Kissing also triggers the release of serotonin, a hormone associated with mood and happiness. Serotonin helps create feelings of pleasure and well-being.</li>
    <li>Adrenaline: Kisses stimulate the release of adrenaline, a hormone associated with excitement and increased heart rate. This hormone can further intensify the feeling of excitement during intimate moments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Gateway of Breasts</h3>
<p>Pay special attention to the breasts and do not skip them! It is necessary to dedicate time to the breasts and give them proper massage using circular motions, focusing on the nipples. It is important to suck the nipples and release them abruptly. Here's why:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By doing so, you further enhance the release of Oxytocin.</li>
  <li>Endorphins: Endorphins are natural opioids that are released during physical activity and pleasure. Breast massage stimulates the release of endorphins, providing a sense of pleasure and relaxation.</li>
  <li>Estrogen: Sucking the nipples stimulates the release of estrogen, which is essential for the proper functioning of the vagina and uterus, promoting necessary lubrication.</li>
  <li>Progesterone: Prepares the uterus for potential pregnancy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only after this, the vagina is ready for your first contact with it. Do not touch it before it's ready!</p>

<h3>The Gateway of Clitoris</h3>
<p>Gentle sucking and licking of the clitoris is recommended until a clitoral orgasm is achieved. Every woman's assistance is welcome. According to research, this type of orgasm is known to approximately 75% of women. Only after reaching a clitoral orgasm, a woman is ready for penetration. All the hormones mentioned earlier will reach the necessary levels to successfully continue with penetration.</p>

<h3>The Gateway of Vagina</h3>
<p>Within the vagina, a magical experience called orgasm occurs. The average length of the vagina is 7-9 cm. In the beginning, the man should engage in penetration slowly and gently, gradually increasing the pace and intensity. For a woman to experience orgasm, she needs to locate her G-spot, the point where she feels the strongest stimulation. Avoid changing positions unless it is uncomfortable, as it may prolong the time needed for a woman to concentrate and reach orgasm. On average, it takes around 30 minutes to achieve a vaginal orgasm. According to official statistics, only 18% of women regularly experience vaginal orgasm.</p>

<p>After a woman experiences a vaginal orgasm, she needs some time to relax and empty her bladder before continuing, as the vaginal orgasm is only the 4th level out of 9. During this time, the man needs to be patient and wait for the woman, who requires a shorter break of around 10-15 minutes. Once the woman is ready to continue, penetration resumes following the same principle. The time needed to reach a full-body orgasm is approximately 30 minutes. You will recognize it when your partner is in a completely relaxed state, similar to a sleeping cat. This orgasm is referred to as "little death" and is unfortunately known by only 1% of the female population. While bringing the woman to "little death," the man himself goes through orgasmic states. For more information on female and male orgasms, please refer to the orgasm pages.</p>
<p>If you're wondering where to find a Superman who can achieve this, the answers can be found on the page about controlling ejaculation. However, I would like to note that every man can practice and improve these skills within 3 months.</p>
<p>If you're wondering why it's important to experience orgasms and what the benefits of this way of making love are, take a look at the page.</p>
